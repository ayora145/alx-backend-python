# Python Generators Project

This project sets up a MySQL database (`ALX_prodev`) and populates it with user data from a CSV file.
It includes a generator that streams rows from the database one by one.

## Files
- `seed.py`: Contains functions to set up and interact with the database.
- `0-main.py`: Main script to test database setup and seeding.
- `user_data.csv`: Sample user data.
